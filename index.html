                        more money. Worked in the Civilian Conservation
                        Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how
                        food changed them", he said. "All of these,
                        left scars on me".

                        studied under Stakman, who taught him about breeding

                        the Pearl Harbor attack, but was rejected. Instead,
                        the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue,
                        DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied
                        science.

                        the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different
                        strains of disease resistent wheat - including

                        with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain
                        that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide
                        95% of Mexico's wheat.

                        food supply by 2050". He argued that genetically modified
                        crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run
                        out of arable land. He said that GM crops are not inherently
                        dangerous because "we have been genetically modifying plants
                        and animals for a long time. Long before we called it
                        science, people have been selecting the best breeds".
