# tribute-page
A basic html static website
This project was inspired by the freecodecamp tribute page project of Dr. Norman Borlaug, which can be found here https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx.
In this project, I have carefully displayed the following HTML skills:
Adding different types of text to a webpage, using headings, lists, and links.
Changing emphasis on text using bold and italics.
Embedding an image on the web page and image captions.
as stated in the project requirement here https://devpractical.com/html-projects-tribute-page/ and https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page
